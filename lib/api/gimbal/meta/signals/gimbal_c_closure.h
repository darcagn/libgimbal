 *  \brief   GblCClosure, C function callback closure, and API
 *
 *  This file contains the definition of and API around
 *  GblCClosure, which is the plain C function implementation
 *  of the GblClosure type.
 *
 *  It simply stores the value of a generic C function pointer,
 *  expecting to have either a marshal or meta marshal which
 *  converts arguments into plain C types, casts the callback
 *  to its correct type, invokes it, passing the arguments,
 *  and stores its return value as a GblVariant.
