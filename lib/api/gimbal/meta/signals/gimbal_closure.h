 *  \ingroup signals
 *  \brief Base instance for all closure types
 *
 *  A GblClosure represents an abstract  generic
 *  callback object. It is analogous to a stateful C++
 *  function object, or functor, in that it can
 *  contain both a callback method as  well as stateful
 *  data to operate upon.
 *
 *  All closures have a single entry-point for
 *  having their callback logic called, which is
 *  GblClosure_invoke(). This calls the closure's
 *  "marshal" function, which is responsible for
 *  - validating arguments and return type
 *  - converting arguments into expected format for callback
 *  - calling actual callback or logic
 *  - converting return value back into a GblVariant
 *
 *  As the abstract base closure, there is no underlying
 *  language-specific callback state within this class.
 *  For calling back into C function pointers, see
 *  GblCClosure.
 *
 *  \note As GblClosure inherits GblBox, it can
 *  contain arbitrary language-specific or
 *  binding-specific userdata and has reference
 *  count semantics.
